# DIY Proofing Box

A proofing box allows you to perfectly control the temperature making
it very easy to ferment sourdough, bread, any dough, pizza or even yoghurt.
Rather than buying one I built one myself and added a raspberry pi. Using
the pi you can see what's happening inside of the proofer and even have
night vision to see what is happening when the lid is closed.

This repo contains the code that I used for the raspberry PI to setup the
live stream and cron job that copies data to cloud storage. For the cloud
support I used [rclone](https://rclone.org/)

I have been using the raspberry pi 4. For the camera module, I have been using
the ["Longruner for Raspberry Pi 4 Camera Kamera Module".](https://amzn.to/3aYCQG3)
